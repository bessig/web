We are looking at the data.gov standards. One issue is that they require spatial range. Some of our datasets have both regular and gaussian grids as part of the same dataset. The lat and lon bounds for those differ slightly.  Is it best to put the widest range, the smallest range or put something like 'global'. Also, we note there is no temporal resolution as part of the standards (monthly, daily...). Is that supposed to go into a description? Is there optional keywords that can be used for that? Any other advice is welcome.
