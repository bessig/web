Hi gang,

Two weeks ago I sent the email below to the group asking for some BESSIG feedback and received a response rate of 8%.  Having spent a fair amount of time organizing these meetings, I found that discouraging. 

Was it just a large scale oversight?  Or is there not enough energy in the community to sustain this effort?  Maybe we need to scale back?  Take a break?

Thanks!

Anne

And anyone could potentially be responsible for the food, and thus the food responsibility could be shared.   Indeed, the meeting location could also be rotated and that responsibility shared too.  Separation of concerns is good!

Though, the room is less than ideal due to its dimensions and location next to the smoking bar.  And, we must provide AV equipment, which is non trivial. The bandwidth is not sufficient for remote participation via Skype.

Regarding the October meeting, would someone from Unidata be willing to cover the Standards and Interoperability topic in the (mentioned) List?

It would be nice to have a big-picture talk on informatics for one meeting.  Has that been done?  Someone in the area an expert on this? Do any of the local biotech companies know about BESSIG?  We are Earth and Space Science, but there might be a lot of informatics expertise in other disciplines.  There are a lot of health informatics hits in a search of the CU website.  Are those relevant to us?

Regarding venue, I prefer LASP.  Alcohol is not important.  It would be nice to have a glass of wine or a beer while listening to a talk, but for me, it improved conversation, but not listening to a technical talk.  :-)  We've been more in the technical talk mode.

Since we start at 4, I don't think food is important.  I can wait until after the meeting to eat.  If people want snacks, that's fine.  I'll chip in.  Dinner is the least important.  It interferes with the program at the Millennium.  It would interfere at LASP.  We'd have to take a break.  The Java users group always has pizza (it is provided by a local company for free), but the meeting goes from 6-9pm.  There's a half-hour break for the pizza.
