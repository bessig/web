The UCAR Software Engineering Assembly is organizing a technical conference to keep software engineers up-to-date and to foster networking and collaboration within UCAR/NCAR and with our peer institutions. The conference is intended as a forum for broad discussion on multiple aspects of software engineering, and will include sessions on diverse topics relevant to software engineering theory and practice.

The conference is intended to appeal to software engineers working at UCAR/NCAR and at other labs and institutions developing software focused on scientific disciplines (e.g. NOAA, NIST, NREL, Universities, SWRI, NASA, DOE, other supercomputing centers, etc.)

It will happen on February 21-23
