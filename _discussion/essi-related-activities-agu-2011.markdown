National Data Infrastructure for Earth System Science

Monday, 5 December, 1815-1915

Location: Moscone West, Room 2008

Efforts to construct cyber-infrastructure spanning the geosciences have been underway for several years in the U.S. and elsewhere around the globe. These efforts are intended to transform the way research is conducted by supporting innovative approaches seeking to integrate data and subsequently knowledge management across the disciplines. This town hall session seeks to explore current activities in this arena in the U.S., such as NSF’s Earth-Cube initiative, and around the globe, such as the WISE effort in Europe. It will highlight the approaches deployed to rally geoscience communities behind this effort and determine their needs, preferences, and priorities.

EarthScope Town Hall

Tuesday, 6 December, 1230-1330

Location: Moscone West, Room 2008

EarthScope enables the interdisciplinary exploration of the structure and evolution of the North American continent by scientists accessing a range of seismological, geodetic, in situ fault zone sampling, geochronology, and high resolution topography resources. EarthScope continues to offer superb opportunities for formal and informal science education in the solid Earth sciences. This town hall meeting introduces the EarthScope National Office at Arizona State University, provides updates on current activities and plans for eastern North America and Alaska, and solicits feedback. The target audience is colleagues interested in the science and broader impacts of EarthScope.

Data Management 101 for the Earth  Scientist

Tuesday, December 6, 2011 - 1:00pm-5:00pm

San Francisco Marriott Marquis, Salons 10-12

Organized by: The Federation of Earth  Science Information Partners 

Earth and Space Science Informatics Reception

Tuesday, 6 December, 1830 - 2000 (NOT 1230-1330)

Location: Hotel Infusion, Infusion Lounge

124 Ellis Street

Regular: $10.00 U.S.

ESSI opted for a paid reception to add hor d’oeuvres and beer to the ‘wine only’ reception offered by AGU. Come and learn about what ESSI has been up to this year, including plans for an ESSI election for 2013. Bring your comments and meet AGU colleagues who appreciate the role of informatics in the pursuit of Earth and space science.

Visual Data Analysis for the Geophysical Sciences

Wednesday, December 7, 2011 - 8:30am-12:30pm

Moscone South: Mezzanine Room 230, AGU Fall Meeting

Organized by: John Clyne and Yuan Ho, NCAR/CISL

Program:

Only a few years ago advanced scientific visualization techniques were largely limited to the realm of visualization experts, and employed primarily as a communication aid to illustrate complex phenomena. Thanks to the commoditization of computer graphics hardware and the emergence of mature, user-friendly software packages the role of scientific visualization has changed from one of merely a communication aid to an indispensible tool for discovery, used not exclusively by visualization experts but by scientists in their day-to-day efforts to analyze data and extract new insights. The goal of this workshop is to provide an overview of some of the open source software packages that are available, and most relevant, to researchers in the geo-sciences. Attendees can expect to gain a basic understanding of the capabilities of these powerful visual data analysis environments; learn which tools may be most appropriate for their own needs; and have an opportunity to talk with tool developers, on-hand for the workshop.

Ignite@AGU

Wednesday Dec. 7, 6-8 pm: An evening of Earth science talks with a twist!

Ignite your passion about applied Earth science. The Federation of Earth Science Information Partners , Sonoma Technology and NASA's Applied Sciences Program together are hosting Ignite@AGU. Ignite is a concept created by O'Reilly Media that has evolved out of the technology community and has become a trend to highlight innovation in many cities and at many conferences. This is not your traditional presentation - talks are 5 minutes, 20 slides and the slides auto-advance, so you must keep moving. This is a chance to push the limits, be creative, outrageous and inspiring. Ignite@AGU is the evening of Wednesday, December 7 in the San Francisco Marriott Marquis. All are welcome to attend this open event and there will be desserts and a cash bar.

The theme for the Ignite@AGU talks will highlight NASA's Applied Earth science focus areas:  Agriculture, Air Quality, Climate, Ecological Forecasting, Public Health, Natural Disasters, Water Resources, and Weather. More importantly, it creatively addresses the NASA's Science Mission Directorate’s need to “bring together members of the scientific communities relevant in order to expose investigators to new subject areas." This event also will be a chance for AGU to showcase and highlight the breadth of AGU member expertise and create connections that may not otherwise occur.
There is still space for presenters, if you are interested in throwing your hat in the ring and giving an Ignite talk. Contact Erin Robinson, erinrobinson@esipfed.org, by November 20th for all the details.
