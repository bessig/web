At our most recent meeting we decided to meet again on Wednesday, 5/18 from 4:00 - 6:00 with this schedule:

4:00 Talk (TBD)

5:00 Business meeting

The group agreed to discuss talk topics and speakers via the web site. 

In retrospect, I think this is a very tight schedule, as in general it would be good to provide a speaker with a two week lead time.  Plus, we have to find someone that can come at the particular hour.  I'm a little nervous about making this goal.

Please contribute to our discussion about identifying a speaker and topic for this upcoming meeting in the Discussion section of the web site.   Thank you!

If anyone is available to sponser snacks or beverages for this meeting please contact me.

Anne
