Thanks to Soren Scott for helping to migrate over to GitHub pages! 

## **B(D)ESSIG relaunch, February 2017**

We (Leslie Hsu, Madison Langseth, Sean Gordon, and Sophie Hou) have been chosen, and have agreed, to organize some BESSIG events in 2017.

On alternating months, events will be held in Lakewood/Golden/Arvada/Denver (Leslie and Madison) and Boulder (Sean and Sophie).

Don't worry, we have read all of the previous posts about the spirit and goals of BESSIG (almost), and will do our best, while trying new things.

In February, we are going to gather at New Terrain in Golden (http://newterrainbrewing.com/), 16401 Table Mountain Pkwy, Golden, CO 80403.

We will meet at 5:00pm, and instead of a presentation this time, will use the day to meet each other (there may be new attendees from the (D)enver area).
