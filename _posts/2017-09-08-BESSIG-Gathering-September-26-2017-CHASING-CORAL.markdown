**BESSIG Gathering September 26,  2017: CHASING CORAL - A PUBLIC SCREENING in Golden, preceded by happy hour at Mountain Toad**

Dear BESSIG:

One of our own members has suggested a great science movie to view together (thanks, Sophie!). Join us on September 26 in Golden, CO for a happy hour and movie night.

A must see film! ['Chasing Coral'](http://www.chasingcoral.com/) reveals a natural wonder dying before our eyes. But there's hope.

Chasing Coral is a film directed by Boulder's own Jeff Orlowski and produced by Larissa Rhodes at Production Labs. Jeff set out to tell the story of vanishing coral reefs around the world that are being threatened at an unprecedented rate. A team of divers, photographers and scientists set out to discover why and to reveal the underwater mystery to the world. It took more than three years to shoot, and is the result of 650 + hours underwater, submissions of footage from volunteers from 30 countries, as well as support from more than 500 people from various locations around the world.

The Boulder Earth and Space Science Informatics Group (BESSIG) will be sponsoring a showing of the film at the Golden, CO Public Library Meeting Room (1019 10th St, Golden, CO 80401) on Tuesday, September 26th, 2017 from 6:00pm to 8:00pm. The group will also get together for happy hour prior to the showing at [Mountain Toad](http://mountaintoadbrewing.com/) (900 Washington Ave., Golden, CO) from 5:00pm to 6:00pm. (Snacks but no alcohol allowed in the library. :)

Please join us if you are in the area! If not, check out Chasing Coral on Netflix and share it with your colleagues, neighbors, and friends!

Let us know if you have any questions.

Sincerely,
Madison (mlangseth@usgs.gov) and Leslie (lhsu@usgs.gov)
