"Informing Science Policy: the Role for Scientists and Engineers"

**A Panel Discussion**

Note: This meeting will be held at NEON Headquarters, instead of our usual location.  Details below.

This month Brian Wee, Steve Aulenbach, and I are delighted to have representatives from law, government and science come together to discuss various aspects of science policy.  We've asked them to consider questions like these:

* What does "science policy" mean to you? To your organization? What impact does it have?
* What are the roles in science policy and what impacts do they have? Who are the main players?
* How have you or your organization tried to impact science policy? What worked and what did not work? What did you learn?
* How does one prepare for a science policy discussion? Any do's and don'ts?
* Scientists and engineers are trained to think and communicate in certain ways. Should those same skills be applied to policy discussions?
* If someone wanted to move more heavily into science policy, how would you advise them? What career moves would be good? Any bad career moves?
