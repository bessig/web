We are dovetailing with the UCAR SEA 2012 Software Engineering Conference, which allows us to have these speakers from out of town.  This is why we are meeting at 5:00 instead of our usual 4:00.   (And also why we are meeting on the 4th Wednesday of the month instead of the 3rd.)

Jay Alameda, NCSA, "Bringing Modern Tools to High Performance Computing - with a Spotlight on XSEDE and Blue Waters"

Chris Mattmann, JPL, "Understanding how to Best Leverage Open Source Data Management Software: A Roadmap" 

**When:** Wednesday, February 22, 5:00 - 7:00

**Where:**  Boulder Outlook Hotel
