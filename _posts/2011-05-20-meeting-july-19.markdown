LASP is located on the University of Colorado's East Campus Research Park.  A map and directions are available on the [LASP Address and Directions](http://lasp.colorado.edu/home/about/address-directions/) page.  The building sits just off Colorado Avenue, immediately adjacent to CU's new, very large biotechnology building that is currently under construction.
