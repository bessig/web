**Brainstorming and Beer**

We will meet on Thursday, February 16th, at [New Terrain Brewing](http://newterrainbrewing.com/) in (north) Golden, CO, from 5:00-6:30p. (16401 Table Mountain Pkwy, Golden, CO 80403)

Sorry if you can’t make it at this time, we hope to see you at a future gathering.

We’ll be inviting local members of the [Community for Data Integration](https://my.usgs.gov/confluence/display/cdi), which is coordinated by USGS but open to anyone interested in the topics of data integration and management. This will add the “D” to B(D)ESSIG (that’s not an official name). 

**GOAL: Meet new people, reunite with old friends, learn what each other do, gather topics for future BESSIG meetings, brainstorm how to communicate Informatics talks in a bar.**
