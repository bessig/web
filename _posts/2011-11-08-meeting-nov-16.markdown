**Panel Report and Discussion on Recent NSF EarthCube Charette**

According to the EarthCube web site, http://earthcube.ning.com/, "The goal of EarthCube is to transform the conduct of research by supporting the development of community-guided cyberinfrastructure to integrate data  and information for knowledge management across the Geosciences."

During November 1 - 4, 2011, the NSF held the EarthCube Charette in Washington, D.C.   The Charette was intended to be "the first stage in an iterative process to build a community-based cyberinfrastructure,"  and an "opportunity for face-to-face interaction and feedback among groups that are suggesting designs for EarthCube and a broad, diverse set of the geosciences and cyberinfrastructure communities."

Panel members for our meeting are Charette attendees who will share their thoughts and experiences. Perhaps we'll finally understand the answer to the question, "What is a charette, anyway?"

**Panel members:** 

Michael Wiltberger, HAO/NCAR 

Russ Rew, Unidata/UCAR

Seth McGinnis, CISL/NCAR 

Scott Peckham, CSDMS/INSTAAR/CU Boulder

Chris MacDermaid, CSU CIRA Fort Collins/NOAA ESRL

**Location:**

This meeting will be held at the Boulder Outlook Hotel and Suites in the Chatauqua room.  The Hotel is near Aurora and 28th St Frontage Road.

**Schedule:** 

4:00 - 5:00: panel and discussion 

5:00 - 6:00: social 

If you attended the Charette and are interested in participating in the panel please contact me ASAP!  The only requirement is a willingness to tell us a little about your experience at the Charrette.  Thank you!
