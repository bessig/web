Bridging Data Lifecycles: Tracking Data Use via Data Citations

April 5-6, 2012 at the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, CO.

Please join us for a workshop on data citation and data use geared to the interests of data manager specialists and librarians. Data citations are increasingly seen as being critical to enabling scientific results to be traced back to their underlying data. Data citations also promote the transparency of scientific work by making data more discoverable, and enable scientists, data managers, and data centers to be credited for producing useful data. Presentations will focus data lifecycles, current options for data citation and data reuse, and will highlight pilot projects in implementing citation standards and practices. Dr. Tim Killeen, Assistant Director for Geosciences at the National Science Foundation will provide the keynote address. Other presenters include Joan Starr of the California Digital Library and Mark Parsons of the National Snow and Ice Data Center. Additional speakers are listed on the workshop web page.

Limited space is available for attendees. More information and the registration form are at http://library.ucar.edu/data_workshop/. Please register by March 23 to ensure your participation. Once registered, participants will be provided with logistical details and any updates to the agenda.

Please feel free to share this information with your colleagues. Contact Matt Mayernik at mayernik@ucar.edu or Karon Kelly at kkelly@ucar.edu if you have questions.
