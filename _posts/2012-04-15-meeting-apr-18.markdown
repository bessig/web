Note the time change: 5:00 instead of 4:00!

This month we'll review the recent UCAR data citation workshop, then make a foray into ontology and semantic-related areas. 

In May and June we'll continue with speakers on ontology and semantic-related topics.  The site calendar  contains more information.  If you have experiences in this area that you are willing to share, please contact Anne.
