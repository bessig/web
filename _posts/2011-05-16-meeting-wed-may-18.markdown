Purpose:  Plan meeting topics for upcoming year, and hobnob

When:  Wednesday, May 18, 2011, 4:00 - 6:00 PM

Where:  Room A200, LASP Space Technology Building, 1234 Innovation Drive, Boulder, Colorado

As we've not identified a talk topic for this meeting, we'll use our time to plan meeting topics and, as much as possible, a schedule for the upcoming year.   Please come to the meeting with your calendar and specific ideas about meeting topics you would like to hear about or might be interested in presenting.   We'll also get to know each other a little better over some light snacks.  If all goes well we could be done early.

I have started a [Meeting Topic and Organizer List](http://lasp.colorado.edu/galaxy/display/BESSIG/Meeting+Topic+and+Organizer+List), check it out.

If you can't make this meeting but would like to provide input, send an email to bessig.info@lasp.colorado.edu (which currently comes to me, Anne).

LASP is located on the University of Colorado's East Campus Research Park.  A map and directions are available on the [LASP locations page](http://lasp.colorado.edu/home/about/address-directions/).  The building sits just off Colorado Avenue, immediately adjacent to CU's new, very large biotechnology building that is currently under construction.   Look for the tallest cranes in town, we're next door to the East.  Free parking is available.
