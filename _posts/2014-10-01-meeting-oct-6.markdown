(red star) We'll be meeting at the Gondolier, http://www.gondolierboulder.com.  The restaurant is in the Meadow's Shopping Center, on the southwest corner of Baseline and Foothills.  We'll meet in their back room.

The Gondolier is providing us this space for free.   In searching for a new venue, I have learned how rare and special it is for a business to provide this.  Please come and order something so that the Gondolier can continue to offer us this space.

**What's an Ontology and What Should I Do With It?**

Beth Huffer, Lingua Logica 

The word "ontology" is used to refer to a variety of different artifacts, from controlled vocabularies that serve as glossaries, to formal ontologies that serve as data schemas for graph databases and/or deductive reasoning systems. This talk will focus on use cases for formal ontologies, with a demonstration of and presentation on ODISEES (Ontology-Driven Interactive Search Environment for Earth Science) which was recently released in beta by the Atmospheric Science Data Center at NASA Langley Research Center. ODISEES provides a parameter-level search environment for discovering ASDC data resources, enabling users to specify a precise set of criteria and get a set of results that exactly match those criteria. Following an overview of the technology behind ODISEES, Beth will discuss additional use cases for formal ontologies of the sort driving ODISEES.
