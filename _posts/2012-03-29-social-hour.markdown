Organized by Mike Daniels and Matt Mayernik, UCAR's EOL/CDS  is hosting a BESSIG social hour in the Atrium at the Boulder Outlook Hotel, on Tuesday, April 3, 2012, at 5:30.  The occasion is the visit of our out of town friends and ESIP colleagues Carol Meyer and Erin Robinson.   EOL/CDS will provide hors d'oeuvres and non alcoholic drinks.   Alcoholic beverages will be available for purchase.

In particular, this is an opportunity to discuss ESIP activities.   Of course, any topic is fair game.   Please join us!

Thank you, UCAR, EOL/CDS, Mike, and Matt!!
